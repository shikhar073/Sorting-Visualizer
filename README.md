# Sorting-Visualizer
Welcome to the Bubble Sort Visualizer! This webpage allows you to interactively visualize the bubble sort algorithm through animated demonstrations. Here's how you can explore:

Initialize Button: Click "init" to generate a randomized sequence of elements, displayed as bars with varying heights, ready for sorting.

Play Button: Click "play" to initiate the bubble sort animation. Watch as the algorithm iterates through the bars, swapping adjacent elements until they are sorted in ascending order.

Immerse yourself in the step-by-step process of bubble sort, gaining insights into its mechanics and efficiency as it rearranges the elements in real-time. Perfect for learning and understanding sorting algorithms interactively.
